  <p><i>*He aproaches you *</i></p>
  <p><b>You:  </b>Hello</p>
  <p><b>Him:  </b>Why were you looking at me?  <i>*His voice is very soft and cute*</i> What do you want?</p>
  <p><i>*You think you recognize his voice, but can't remember from where though*</i></p>
  <p><b>You:  </b>I just think I've seen you before</p>
  <p><b>Him:  </b>Really? I've never seen you before</p>
  <p><i>*Something feels odd, but you remember something and grab your phone.*</i></p>
